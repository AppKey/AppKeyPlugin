AppKeyPlugin

Source code for an AppKey plugin for the Unity 3d environment.  This project wraps
the AppKeySDK and enables Unity developers to use it without the need to learn
java android development.  This plugin produces a jar file that can be used directly in
a Unity project, or by using the AppKeyPluginSample Unity project examples. We suggest you
use the version that comes bundled with the AppKeyPlugin unity package. It combines
this plugin with some Unity-side C# code to ease integration.

As always, we're happy to help if you have any questions. support@appkey.com
